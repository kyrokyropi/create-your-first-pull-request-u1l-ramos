I expect this subject to be fun and at the same time challenging for me. I am interested in web programming so that's why I am excited to take this course
I expect to do good in both lab and lecture but I know that it wouldn't be that easy. I know that my professors will be guiding me on how to do web programming.
All in all, I am very excited about this course and I am hoping to enjoy it!


Nice one! goodluck pi this sem!
